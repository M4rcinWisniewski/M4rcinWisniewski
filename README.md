# 👋 Hi, I'm Marcin!

🎓 1st-year Computer Science student at Silesian University of Technology  
🦀 Rust & C++ enthusiast | 🎮 Aspiring Game Developer | 🔍 Systems & Engine Design

---

## 🚧 Currently Building

- ♟️ **Rust Chess Engine** — full engine in progress with bitboard logic, clean modular design, and future evaluation & search

---

## 🎯 Goals for 2025

- ✅ Finish 1st year of Computer Science
- 🔨 Finish the full Rust chess engine (with game logic, evaluation, and UCI)
- 🧪 Keep learning C++ through hands-on game dev & system design

---

## 💡 What I Enjoy

- Writing fast, clean, and expressive low-level code  
- Designing systems from scratch (game loops, engines, rule logic)  
- Learning through building and shipping  
- Exploring how games, engines, and simulations work under the hood
